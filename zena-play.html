    <p>Zena Goldin Posever (1911-2012) was an artist for as long as she could remember. The Philadelphia public school system helped nurture her drawing talent, and after high school, she continued her studies both informally at the Graphic Sketch Club and several Philadelphia art schools and colleges. Life studies and abstractions derived from them fill her early sketchbooks. At the Art Department of the urban Settlement Music School, for example, she learned how to create and apply colored patina to plaster from Antonio Cortizas and honed her teaching skills when she assisted him in teaching art to hospital patients.</p>
    <p>In 1937, she became a three-year scholarship student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the premier art school in America, where figurative art reigned as it had in Europe. Zena accomplished large- and small-scale sculpture, which reflected control of human anatomy and mastery of figural composition. Under the guidance of her teachers, the preeminent portrait sculptor Walker Hancock, drawing master George Demetrios and Albert Laessle, medal sculptor, she won several prizes. Her final year culminated in the award of Cresson Scholar in Sculpture, which included a traveling fellowship and precious studio space to continue working.</p>

    <p>Zena’s subjects reveal her compassion for mineworkers and their families, refugees, and aspects of freedom – reflected in the themes of music, play and the Bill of Rights. <i>Play</i>, an analogy of her happy childhood years with her sister made in 1939-40, was Zena’s favorite sculpture. Its compositional inspiration stemmed from her visit to Picasso’s first American retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p>

    <p>Picasso’s newly completed <i>Guernica</i>, his anti-war statement in response to the atrocity bombing of the cultural capital of the Spanish Basque region, had special resonance for Zena. Upon each return she made to the Museum, she would stop to pay the work homage. Her husband of one year had gone to Spain as an American volunteer with the international brigades, which fought for the Republicans against Franco’s Nationalists. One month after he got there, a sniper shot and killed him.</p>

    <p>Zena was no stranger to tragedy. Her sister, close in age to her, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her teenage years, for which no successful treatment then existed, and for a decade, the family had tried to find her. While the movement of the rhythmic and joyful <i>Play</i> calls up that early family tragedy.</p>
